    <p>An object is a collection of variable and function that
        technically called properties and methods.
    </p>

    <script>
        // An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:
        const user = new Object() // "object constructor" syntax
        const users = {} // "object literal" syntax

        // Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
        // We can immediately put some properties into {...} as 
        // "key: value" pairs:

        const person = {
            firstName: 'John',
            age: 50
        }

        alert(`firstName: ${person.firstName}`)
        alert(`Age: ${person.age}`)
    </script>
</body>
